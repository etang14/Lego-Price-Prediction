# LEGO Price Prediction

Lego is the largest toy manufacturer on the planet. New releases and advertising increasingly skew 
towards adult collectors, the prevalence of individuals reselling Lego for profit is rising, and the 
Lego Company is increasing its media partnerships and licenses. Recent news coverage from the 
Wall Street Journal even considers Lego an “investment opportunity.”

In this project, the rise of Lego as a giant in the toy industry is analyzed. Additionally, the 
viability of Lego for collectible investing and the ability of predictive machine learning models to 
determine winners and losers is explored. Examining the pricing and features for Lego products over 
the past fifty years, this project considers the ability for trends in pricing, piece count, 
consumer ratings, and nostalgia to account for Lego’s rise. Furthermore, this project provides insights 
into the ability of modern machine learning methods such as regression, ensemble, and deep learning 
models to confidently predict a Lego product’s current pricing.
